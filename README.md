# Azure-DevOps-GitHub-Integration-Toolkit
This repo contains a collection of small programs for custom integration use cases between Azure DevOps and GitHub.

For most cases, integrations are either [Azure DevOps Service Hooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/service-hooks/overview?view=azure-devops) or [GitHub Webhooks ](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks).
