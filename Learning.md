# VSS Extensions Learning Notes
This document contains random notes for learning VSS Extensions.

## Samples (that work as of Jan-2023)
As VSS Extensions is not very well documented, one of the best ways to learn is through looking at available open-sourced extensions.
Unfortunately, a lot of it no longer work for various reasons (developed for older versions of Azure DevOps, using old node modules, etc.). This list contains the extension code samples that I was able to deploy.
